# covid-cxr-cnn-classification
CNN model for COVID-19 CXR image classification. Implements convolutional neural networks to classify Normal, Viral, and COVID-19 chest X-ray images.

# COVID-19 CXR Image Classification using CNN
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation for classifying chest X-ray (CXR) images into three categories: **Normal**, **Viral**, and **COVID-19**.

## Objective
To develop a CNN model capable of detecting and classifying different types of pulmonary diseases from chest X-ray images, with a focus on COVID-19 identification.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of posteranterior (PA) chest X-ray images of:
- Normal patients
- Viral pneumonia patients
- COVID-19 affected patients
